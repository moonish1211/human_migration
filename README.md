Instructor feedback on proposal:<br>
Interesting project with large-scale dataset.

- The definition and number of edges in this dataset is unclear to me as it exceeds 232^2*10 which is the number of edges I would expect in a decade. 
- Is the temporal resolution more refined than a single year?
- Are the edges weighted by number of migrants? If they are all binary then this would be close to a complete network probably.

- Temporal analysis: could you model migration patterns over time (e.g., migration peaks during crises, then declines) and relate these to global / regional events as you suggest?

- Comparison to network models learned in class - is the migration network random? is it scale-free?

- For visualization, plotting the network and patterns overlaid on an atlas of the world would strengthen visualization and interoperability.
